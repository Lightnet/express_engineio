  Information:
By using the express, engine.io, engine.io-client
and protobufjs to handle nodejs server and web 
browser access wrap around the web socket connection
in bi-directional connection.

Sharing libraries to must have bi-directional 
connection to have same functions that share nodejs
and javascript browser to able to code and decode
binary buffer data.

The library that I used is protobufjs to send and
receive object class message style. This is simple
build of the engine.io.

 Nodejs packges:
  * Express
  * Engine.io
  * Engine.io-client
  * protobufjs
  
[build & run]
```
cmd line

npm install

node server.js
```
